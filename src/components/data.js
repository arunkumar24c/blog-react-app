        Title: 'For Argentina’s Champions, Back to Work Means Back to Earth',
        Discription: 'When Alexis Mac Allister returned to his day job, he was greeted by a standing ovation, an Argentine flag and a set of strategically placed cannons that showered him with blue, white and gold glitter. His Premier League team, Brighton, had even gone to the trouble of commissioning a scale-model replica of the World Cup trophy for him to lift.Few of Mac Allister’s teammates on the Argentina squad that became world champions three months ago experienced such a lavish welcome when they returned to their clubs, but most were treated to some sort of celebration, a heartfelt recognition of their achievement. Defender Lisandro Martínez was applauded onto the field at Manchester United. The reserve goalkeeper Franco Armani has received at least one commemorative jersey from his opponents. The midfielder Exequiel Palacios spent a portion of his first day back at Bayer Leverkusen signing autographs for his co-workers.Marcos Acuña, Alejandro Gómez and Gonzalo Montiel — the scorer of the penalty that brought his nation its third World Cup — were invited to take part in a ceremonial kickoff before their first home game for their club, Sevilla. Acuña and Montiel appeared with their gold medals around their necks. Gómez, wearing a black trench coat, clasped his in his fist.',

        Discription: 'Willis Reed, the brawny and inspirational hub of two Knicks championship teams that captivated New York in the early 1970s with a canny, team-oriented style of play, died on Tuesday. He was 80. His death was confirmed by his former teammate Bill Bradley, the former United States senator. He said Reed had congestive heart issues. It was not clear where Reed died, but he had been under treatment at the Texas Heart Institute in Houston, Bradley said. Reed was notably absent last month, for health reasons, when the Knicks celebrated their 1972-73 championship team during a 50th-anniversary halftime ceremony at Madison Square Garden attended by many former members of that squad, including Bradley, Walt Frazier, Dick Barnett, Earl Monroe and Jerry Lucas. Reed spoke to the crowd in a prerecorded video. In an era when Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain were the more celebrated big men, Reed was a highly skilled 6-foot-9 center with a resolute physicality that was much admired over a 10-year career, though it was marred by injury and ended at 31.',

        Discription: 'Kathy Whitworth, who joined the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour in the late 1950s when it was a blip on the national sports scene and who went on to win 88 tournaments, a record for both women and men on the United States tours, died on Saturday. She was 83. Whitworth was at a neighborhood Christmas party in Flower Mound, Texas, where she lived, when she collapsed and died soon after, Christina Lance, an LPGA spokeswoman, said. Whitworth, who turned pro at 19, was the LPGA Tour’s leading money winner eight times and became the first women’s pro to win more than $1 million in prize money when she finished third in the 1981 Women’s Open, the only major tournament she didn’t win. She earned more than $1.7 million lifetime in an era when purses were modest. “I would have swapped being the first to make a million for winning the Open, but it was a consolation which took some of the sting out of not winning,” she said in a profile for the World Golf Hall of Fame.',

        Discription: 'Mike Grier, who spent 14 seasons in the N.H.L. as a gritty right wing, on Tuesday was named general manager of the San Jose Sharks, becoming the first Black general manager in the history of a league that just completed its 105th season. Grier, 47, who retired as a player in 2011, comes to the team after having worked as a scout for Chicago and spending two years as an assistant coach with the Devils. Last season, he worked as a hockey operations adviser to the Rangers, reporting to the team’s president and general manager, Chris Drury, who played with Grier at Boston University and with the Buffalo Sabres. Grier comes from an accomplished sporting family. His older brother, Chris, has been the general manager of the Miami Dolphins since 2016, and his father, Bobby, was a college running back and a coach with the New England Patriots before taking front-office jobs with the Patriots, the Houston Texans and the Dolphins. “The main thing my father instilled in us is work ethic,” Mike Grier said in a news conference in San Jose, Calif. “He left for work before we got up for school and sometimes he wouldn’t get home until after dinner or when we were ready to get in bed. He’d stay up till all hours to scout, whatever needed to be done.”',

        Discription: 'TAMPA, Fla. — He was somewhere downtown, Anthony Volpe remembers, though not near City Hall, because he didn’t hear the speeches. Wherever he started in that giddy crowd of Yankees fans, he ended up in front.“My sister and I, we were tiny, so we weaseled our way in,” Volpe said last week, all grown up now, in the Yankees’ clubhouse at spring training. “We were pretty much right next to the gate. It was amazing.”Volpe was 8 years old on that crisp November afternoon in 2009, just another beaming face at the Yankees’ championship parade, basking in the glory of a World Series title. He could not tell exactly who was gliding by, but to him they were all legends. “I was so small that I could honestly hardly even see on top of the float, but it didn’t matter,” said Volpe, who grew up in Watchung, N.J., 40 miles southwest of Yankee Stadium. “What I remember about it is, no matter who was there, everyone was just going crazy. It could have been someone you never even see on TV, but they’re a part of the team and they probably got just as big a cheer.” Volpe, 21, will be on TV a lot this season. The Yankees named him to their opening day roster on Sunday, meaning he will work on the same patch of dirt where his favorite player, Derek Jeter, once roamed.',

        Title: 'Save the Gowns!',
        Discription: 'The concept of museum-worthy clothes is arguably as old as museums themselves. But only in modern history did blockbuster fashion exhibits really take off. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the 2018 exhibition “Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination” drew some 1.6 million guests, according to the museum. “Romantic and Glamorous Hollywood Design,” an exhibition that opened in 1974, had about 780,000 visitors. Matthew Yokobosky, the senior curator of fashion and material culture at the Brooklyn Museum, which over the past two years has staged exhibits on the designers Christian Dior, Thierry Mugler and Virgil Abloh, said the interest in seeing clothes on display has risen as “the occasions for getting dressed up have diminished.” Preserving collections for posterity has not always been a priority in the fashion industry, which is focused heavily on the future (by the time that most brands’ spring clothes are released, they are already showing pieces for fall). “I remember having a conversation with Valentino,” Mr. Yokobosky recalled, referring to the Italian fashion designer who started his namesake label in 1960. “He said, ‘We weren’t thinking exhibition, we were trying to sell dresses.’”',

        Title: 'The Avatars Wear Prada',
        Discription: 'Last October, after Mark Zuckerberg had unveiled his vision for the new Meta (formerly Facebook) and the amazing future that awaited in Web 3.0, and been roundly teased for his decision to do so via an avatar wearing exactly the same thing Mr. Zuckerberg wears in his everyday life — this, in a world of infinite possibility! — Meta picked up on the problem and threw down a gauntlet of sorts. “Hey, Balenciaga,” the company tweeted, “What’s the dress code in the metaverse?” This week Balenciaga responded, along with Prada and Thom Browne, courtesy of Meta’s new avatar fashion store, which began a rollout to users in the United States, Canada, Thailand and Mexico. Though the social media company had offered a variety of free (and generic) outfits for avatars used on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, this is the first time it has enlisted named designers to create looks-for-purchase for virtual selves. And the answer is … a red Balenciaga logo hoodie. Also some ripped jeans and a plaid shirt, a motocross jumpsuit, a black skirt suit, and low-rise jeans paired with a crop logo tee and logo briefs (four outfits in total). Quintessential Balenciaga looks, in other words, for anyone who has followed the brand. Just as Thom Browne’s offering, a shrunken gray three-piece suit, pleated gray skirt suit and shorts outfit is Mr. Browne’s trademark uniform. And as at least one of Prada’s four looks — a white tank top with logo triangle and tiered skirt — seemed to come straight from the most recent runway (though they, too, offer the perennial logo sweatshirt). But still, that’s it? These are four of the most creative, considered fashion designers working today — Demna of Balenciaga, Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons of Prada, and Mr. Browne — designers whose clothes IRL grapple with the way social and political forces shape identity at the most essential levels; designers whose work has tackled climate change, gender, war, capitalism, questions of value and viral celebrity. And all they (or maybe their digital, merchandising and marketing teams) could come up with when tasked to imagine dress in a space unbound by gravity and any kind of physical limitation are cartoon copies of among the most familiar clothes they already sell?',

        Title: 'The Life and Death of Your Jeans',
        Discription: 'Early on in “Unraveled,” a new book about the dark underbelly of fashion, the author, Maxine Bédat, describes walking through a factory in Guangdong, China, that specializes in acid-washing jeans, picking her way over dark puddles of “iridescent, bubbling content” that had spilled from industrial washing machines and was sloshing around on the floor. This is a hundred pages or so before she is warned not to wear makeup to a landfill in Kpone, an area in Ghana where 2.8 million items of castoff clothing are added per week, because “the chemicals in the landfill would make mascara congeal on my eyelashes.” The book is the latest entry in a growing genre of nonfiction: the consumption horror story. It’s as scary as any adult tale Roald Dahl ever wrote. (Indeed, if he were alive today, he might well imagine a fashionista who got swallowed by a mountain of discarded finery.) But as we prepare for the re-emergence, and how and where we shop once again becomes a topic of conversation, is it scary enough?',

        Title: 'Why Fashion Can’t Get Enough of the Bloomsbury Group',
        Discription: 'At Dior Men’s spring 2023 show last June, the brand’s artistic director, Kim Jones, sent out models in sweaters printed with Post-Impressionist works by the early 20th-century painter Duncan Grant, a member of the constellation of British artists and intellectuals known as the Bloomsbury Group. As a teenager, Jones had moved with his family to the East Sussex village of Lewes, not far from Charleston, the 16th-century farmhouse Grant leased with Vanessa Bell, also a painter. Now a museum, the house was a gathering place for the endlessly mythologized Bloomsberries, that loose collective of friends and creative conspirators who “lived in squares, painted in circles and loved in triangles,” as an observer once famously noted, and which included Bell’s sister Virginia Woolf, the fellow writers E.M. Forster and Lytton Strachey, the economist John Maynard Keynes and the art critics Roger Fry and Clive Bell.Like other British designers before him — among them Erdem’s Erdem Moralioglu, and Christopher Bailey, when he was at Burberry — Jones keeps finding fresh inspiration in Grant and his cohort: their dishabille and their rejection of Victorian England’s conservative values. The curator Darren Clarke, who recently mounted a show at Charleston of Grant’s previously unseen homoerotic drawings from the late 1940s and ’50s, was attracted to the artist’s tender but also explicit and humorous celebration of gay love. With Bloomsbury, “it feels like everything has been written about them,” he says. “But then it always surprises you that something else comes along.”',

        Title: 'Pasta That’s Almost Too Pretty to Eat',
        Discription: 'David Rivillo’s rainbow ravioli is equal parts art and science. The 45-year-old Venezuelan, who’s now based in Porto Alegre, Brazil, started making colorful patterned pasta in 2019 in homage to his favorite artist, Carlos Cruz-Diez, a Venezuelan known for his chromatic relief murals who died that year at the age of 95. Putting his Ph.D. in chemistry to good use, Rivillo experimented with natural dyes (such as spirulina and paprika) to find those that would maintain their hue even when dried or cooked and posted his work on Instagram. Now, Rivillo, who recently left his job as a nanotechnology researcher to pursue the project full time, sells his creations (from $40 for 2.1 ounces, plus shipping). And he isn’t the only noodle maker playing with psychedelic designs. The Sydney, Australia-based artist Jennifer Tran, 39, makes candy-striped rigatoni and checkerboard tortellini, as well as floral-print pasta sheets that look more like textiles than food. And in California, Fiona Afshar, 57, takes visual inspiration from her local farmers’ market and from her Malibu garden, adorning paccheri with yellow and purple blooms and ravioli with tiny images of lemons and limes. Employing highly pigmented ingredients like beet powder, activated charcoal and harissa, she sells multivariety gift boxes (from $95) through her website. The only problem with these Technicolor carbs? They’re almost too pretty to eat. Says Rivillo of his pasta: “People take a long time to get the courage to cook it.” @david_rivillo; @_papetal_; fionaspasta.com. — Ella Riley-Adams Designers increasingly celebrate Indigenous forms but often confine themselves to a single cultural inspiration. Prateek Jain and Gautam Seth, a couple in their 40s who founded Klove Studio 17 years ago in New Delhi, take a very different approach. Their Totems Over Time are created to gently illuminate not merely a room but the ways in which so many primordial civilizations employed surprisingly complementary motifs, no matter how geographically or historically distant from one another they might have been.
